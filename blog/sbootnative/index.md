### Native Application with Spring Native and JPA
In this post, we are going to run through a step by step approach on creating a containerised native Spring Boot application. It is assumed that you already have basic familiarity with Spring Boot. We are going to use Gradle as the build system and Kotlin as the programming language. As of the time this post is written, latest Spring Boot version is 2.5.2, hence the version we are using here.

---
#### Background
Cloud native has been quite a buzz-word lately. More and more people and organisations are realising the importance of having applications deployed in a container suitable for cloud environment. Spring as one of the early Java framework realises this and come up with [Spring Boot project](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot#overview){:target=_blank}. Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run". Spring team takes an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration.

As part of the cloud native initiatives, people can hardly run away from microservice architecture. Microservice architectures are like the ‘new normal’. Building small, self-contained, ready to run applications can bring great flexibility and added resilience to the code. Spring Boot can help here by providing many purpose-built features to make it easy to build and run microservices in production at scale.

Java ecosystem has had a huge improvements lately, especially on the JVM. With new garbage collector that provides faster and more predictable pause time, including JIT (Just In-time Compilation), we can have a better performant Java applications. Whilst Java applications by itself is not bad, sometimes there is a need to have a faster start-up time and lower memory footprint for our applications, especially when we are deploying it on the cloud where containers are shutdown and brought-up on demand and automatically. This is where the idea of compiling Java based applications to native executable comes to the fruition.

---
#### Here Comes Spring Native
Taken from the Spring website, Spring Native provides support for compiling Spring applications to native executables using the GraalVM native-image compiler. Compared to the Java Virtual Machine, native images can enable cheaper and more sustainable hosting for many types of workloads. These include microservices, function workloads, well suited to containers, and Kubernetes

Using native image provides key advantages, such as instant startup, instant peak performance, and reduced memory consumption. There are also some drawbacks and trade-offs that the GraalVM native project expect to improve on over time. Building a native image is a heavy process that is slower than a regular application. A native image has fewer runtime optimizations after warmup. Finally, it is less mature than the JVM with some different behaviors.

The goal of the Spring Native is to be an alternative to Spring JVM, and provide a native deployment option designed to be packaged in lightweight containers. In practice, the target is to support Spring applications, almost unmodified, on this new platform. Learn more about [Spring Native project](https://docs.spring.io/spring-native/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/){:target=_blank} from its website.

### Getting Started
For this demo application, I will be using MariaDB as its backend database. I am using Docker to run the MariaDB. Since I'm on Windows, I'm using Docker Desktop. If you do not have Docker installed in your environment, please follow the installation guide specific for your environment.

#### Installing MariaDB
First of all, let's download the MariaDB docker container. You may skip this step if you already have MariaDB docker container in your environment. Execute the command `docker pull mariadb` to download the MariaDB docker container.
<pre>
PS C:\Users\Handra> docker pull mariadb
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from library/mariadb
c549ccf8d472: Pull complete

Status: Downloaded newer image for mariadb:latest
docker.io/library/mariadb:latest
</pre>

By issuing `docker images` command, you should be able to see that the `mariadb` container is heter.
<pre>
PS C:\Users\Handra> docker images
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
mariadb      latest    6d5c5ed114ad   2 weeks ago   408MB
</pre>

#### Running MariaDB
Now that we have the MariaDB installed in our Docker, let's run it using `docker run -e MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=foo123 --rm --name mariadb -p3306:3306 mariadb`. Using this command, you should have a MariaDB server running in your workstation listening at port 3306. The `root` password is `foo123` (obviously don't do it in production) as specified in the command. You may change it to something else based on your needs.

You should see output like below:
<pre>
PS C:\Users\Handra> docker run -e MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=foo123 --rm --name mariadb -p3306:3306 mariadb

2021-07-11 03:45:35+00:00 [Note] [Entrypoint]: Initializing database files


PLEASE REMEMBER TO SET A PASSWORD FOR THE MariaDB root USER !
To do so, start the server, then issue the following commands:

'/usr/bin/mysqladmin' -u root password 'new-password'
'/usr/bin/mysqladmin' -u root -h  password 'new-password'

Alternatively you can run:
'/usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation'

which will also give you the option of removing the test
databases and anonymous user created by default.  This is
strongly recommended for production servers.

See the MariaDB Knowledgebase at https://mariadb.com/kb or the
MySQL manual for more instructions.

Please report any problems at https://mariadb.org/jira

#### Create Spring Boot Project
Now that we have the database server ready, let's create a new Spring Boot project by going to https://start.spring.io. The following screenshot gives a glimpse of the project details and dependencies.

![startspringboot](start.png)

As can be seen from the above screenshot, we need to have the following dependencies:
 - Spring Native (Experimental)
 - Spring Data JPA
 - MySQL Driver
 - Spring Web

As you can see, as of when this post is written, Spring Native is still in the experimental stage, so breaking changes might still happen in the future.

---
### Preparing Database
For this demo application, we are going to create just a simple `user` table containing `username` and `fullname`. We will name our database `demonative`.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE demonative;
USE demonative;

CREATE TABLE user (
    username VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    fullname VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
```

After successfully executed the above script, you should now have `demonative` database with `user` table inside.

![demonative database](db.png)
--- 

### Configuring Application to Connect
Now, let's open our `application.properties` file and put the following configuration.

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://mariadbserver:3306/demonative
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=foo123
```

The part `mariadbserver:3306` refers to the hostname and port where the MariaDB is running and listening on. If you are using different host and port, then you will want to adjust this parameter accordingly. Similary, if you are using different username and password, please adjust accordingly.

---
### Test Running our Application
Now, let's try to run our application. When everything is OK, our application should be up and running without any problem.

We can use command `.\gradlew.bat bootRun` on Windows or `./gradlew bootRun` on Unix environment.

To stop the application, you can simply press `CTRL + C`.

### Create Entity Class and Repository
At this stage, we can conclude that our application is up and running. Now, let's create the entity class and repository to deal with our user data.

<blockquote>
For simplicity, we are going to put all the classes and interfaces into the same file. In the real programming tasks though, you might want to categorise the entity classes and interfaces into different packages or files based on your own code structure and standard.
</blockquote>

First, let's create a `User` class that reflects the structure of the `user` table in the database.
```kotlin
@Entity
@Table(name = "user")
data class User(
    @Id
    @Column(name = "username", length = 255, nullable = false)
    var username: String,

    @Column(name = "fullname", length = 255, nullable = false)
    var fullname: String,
)
```

Then, let's create a `UserRepository` interface that provides interface to connect with the database.
```kotlin
@Repository
interface UserRepository : CrudRepository<User, String>
```

---
### Create REST API
In order not to over-complicate our application, we will just create TWO (2) endpoints for this demo application. ONE (1) endpoint is used to list users data, and another endpoint is used to add new user data.

#### API Entity
Our REST API accepts request data in JSON format. Let's create a class that represents our add user request.

```kotlin
data class AddUserRequest(
    val username: String,
    val fullname: String,
)
```

The above class is equivalent to the following JSON representation:
```json
{
    "username": "<VALUE>",
    "fullname": "<VALUE>"
}
```

#### REST API Controller
Let's create a new class named `UserController`. This class will be annotated with `@RestController` annotation to indicate that it will serve as a REST API.

We add TWO (2) methods inside as needed. One for listing all the users data, and another one to add a new user data.

```kotlin
@RestController
class UserController(
    private val userRepository: UserRepository,
) {

    @GetMapping("/users")
    fun users(): ResponseEntity<List<User>> = ResponseEntity.ok(this.userRepository.findAll().toList())

    @PostMapping("/user")
    fun addUser(@RequestBody addUserRequest: AddUserRequest): ResponseEntity<Void> {
        return try {
            val newUser = User(username = addUserRequest.username, fullname = addUserRequest.fullname)
            this.userRepository.save(newUser)
            ResponseEntity.ok().build()
        } catch (ex: DataAccessException) {
            ResponseEntity.internalServerError().build()
        }
    }
}
```

---
### Test Run

Now, let's run back our application and make sure that it is responding correctly.

If you call the endpoint <http://localhost:8080/users>, you should receive the response. At first, it will be empty as we do not yet have any user data.
![List users empty](listuser1.png)

Let's try to add ONE (1) new user by calling the <http://localhost:8080/user> endpoint using HTTP `POST` method.
![Add user](adduser.png)

Now, if we try to list down the users again, we should be able to see one new user has been added to the system.
![List users 1 user](listuser2.png)

This proves that our application is up and running.

---
### Modify for Environment Variable
Now, to make our application ready, instead of hardcoding some of the database information, we should modify it to use environment variable instead. Let's open back our `application.properties` file and change the content to:
```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://${DBHOST}:${DBPORT}/${DBNAME}?user=${DBUSER}&password=${DBPASS}
```

This means that we will be using environment variables `DBHOST`, `DBPORT`, `DBNAME`, `DBUSER`, and `DBPASS` as parameters to build our database connection. We will see why it's needed later.

---
### Building the Native Image
Now that we know our application is up and running with JVM, let's build the native executable of our Spring Boot application. To do this, we can simply execute the command `.\gradlew.bat bootBuildImage` on Windows or `./gradlew bootBuildImage` on Unix environment.

Depending on your computer's power, this will take some time to complete. Grab a ☕ and wait for it to complete.

Once completed, you should see result similar as below.
![Build native completed](buildnative.png)

As you can see, it took around 15 minutes and 38 seconds on my machine to complete the whole process.

This process builds a new docker image that contains the native executable. If you do command `docker images`, you should be able to see a new docker image created with regards to this application (i.e.: `demonative:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT`)

```powershell
PS D:\IdeaProjects\demonative> docker images
REPOSITORY                 TAG              IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE

demonative                 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT   23e1a25317dd   41 years ago   177MB
```

The `paketobuildpacks/*` containers are used by the Spring Native during the process.

---
### Running and Testing
Now, let's run our native Spring Boot application using the following command `docker run --rm -e DBHOST=192.168.1.105 -e DBPORT=3306 -e DBNAME=demonative -e DBUSER=root -e DBPASS=foo123 --name demonative -p 8080:8080 demonative:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT`

</pre>

Note that you have to adjust the environment variables (`DBHOST`, `DBPORT`, `DBNAME`, `DBUSER`, and `DBPASS`) values accordingly based on your environment.

You can see above that the application starts only within 0.223 seconds, compared to the JVM version which takes around 2 seconds to start.

Now, let's call again our add user API.
![Add user with native](adduser2.png)

We can see that the add user operation is successful. We will now call again our list users API.
![List users with native](listuser3.png)

You can see that we now have TWO (2) users, each with username `username1` that we have previously added and `username2` which we just added. This shows that our APIs are still working as well in native mode.

---
That's all. By adding a dependency, we are able to build a native executable of our Spring Boot application. This makes our application can now start and serve requests extremely quickly compared to using the JVM version.

I believe it will be improved in the future, but currently it requires a lot of processing power and time on our build system to compile our Java application into native executable, so do keep this in mind. You might want to keep using the JVM version during your development-testing phase, and compile to native executable only when things are confirmed so that you can do the final testing.

I hope this is helpful and the source code for this is available at Github [here](https://github.com/handracs2007/demonative){:target=_blank}.

Cheers
